Flight Test Event Marker Notes

RS-232 spec defines specific functions for each wire.  See:

It seems that the Data Carrier Detect or Data Set Ready lines could be used for the Event Marker, as they could be steady high or low.

But, there will be no synchronous data being sent.  Will this confuse Device::SerialPort?  No - it works.

Device::SerialPort will export line status if the :STAT tag is set.  See the docs.

Test on 8 March 2005:

    works with MS_RLSD_ON for a signal on pin 1, with ground as pin 5
    works with MS_DSR_ON for a signal on pin 6, with ground as pin 5
    works with MS_CTS_ON for a signal on pin 8, with ground as pin 5
    works with MS_RING_ON for a signal on pin 9, with ground as pin 5
    
    So, could in principle use one serial port to monitor up to four discretes
    The signal is sensed when there is voltage on the pin in question.
    
    Use one signal for an event marker, one for boost pump (to look for coorelation
    between boost pump ON, fuel pressure and fuel flow).
