New devices can be added by adding more modules Most of the setup is in the fdr.ini file. Current settings use about 5% of my cpu time using simulated 2 devices, real world should be less as the actual data rate will be less than the 100 scans/sec it is currently set up for. rates in fdr.ini are in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 sec) Program is setup for simulated serial data, this can be changed on line 20 by setting '$simulate{serial} = 0' for real data. Only one parameter changes in the simulated data. Data is save on comma seperated format for easy importation into a spreadsheet. Let me know what you think or if you have any problems. Mike.Attachment converted: Main:fdr.pl ( / ) (04196997) Attachment converted: Main:fdr.ini ( / ) (04196998) Attachment converted: Main:D10A.mod ( / ) (04196999) Attachment converted: Main:NMEA0183v2.mod ( / ) (0419699A)
