EIS data capture notes  

Data characteristics
  Exactly 15 minutes of good raw data recorded by Zterm - /Users/kwh/ftdata/EIS/EIS_15_mn_1-22-05.data
  756,009 bytes = 738k.  Need to read at least 150 bytes at a time to ensure that one good contiguous record is found in each chunk.  Can get 5039 records in 15 minutes, or a max data rate of 5.6 records per second.  The raw data output is probably around 11 hz.  Each record is 73 bytes, including the header, checksum and the spare byte.
  
  The data rate = 840 bytes/s, or 0.0012 seconds per byte, or 1.2 ms per byte.
  
  
History
25 Jan 05 - EIStest.pl rev 8 - first successful recording of raw data from EIS to PowerBook with no bad checksums.
28 Jan 05 - EIStest.pl rev 9 - reworked to use tied filehandles, and to also read data from a raw data file for testing.
30 Jan 05 - EIStest.pl rev 10 - first successful recording of data at a desired data rate, then decoding it and writing it to disk with Hi-Res time tag.


Using data
Gnumeric will open the data files directly, putting each parametre in its own column.


To do:
  What does $PortObj->purge_rx; do?
  
  Add config file that specifies which parametres should be written to disk.
  
  Add command line switch for data rate.
  
  Create watchdog program to start a new process if the original one dies or hangs up.
