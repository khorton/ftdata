Model 4000/6000 Serial Data ListAll data is transmitted at 9600 baud, one stop bit, no parity. The first 3 bytes are a header that is unique, and will not show up in the data stream.All 2 byte data is listed with an "H" and an "L" following the name of the data.  To combine these two bytes into the result, multiply the high word by 256 and add the low word to the result.All data is scaled with the least significant bit = 1 unless noted. All data is unsigned unless noted.$FE        ; Header word #1 (Decimal 254)$FF        ; Header word #2 (Decimal 255)$FE        ; Header word #3 (Decimal 254)TACHH      ; Tachometer - Resolution = 1TACHLCHT1H      ; CHT and EGT follow all haveCHT1L      ; a resolution of 1 degCHT2HCHT2LCHT3HCHT3LCHT4HCHT4LCHT5HCHT5LCHT6HCHT6LEGT1HEGT1LEGT2HEGT2LEGT3HEGT3LEGT4HEGT4LEGT5HEGT5LEGT6HEGT6LDAUX1H      ; ReservedDAUX1L      ; ReservedDAUX2H      ; ReservedDAUX2L      ; ReservedASPDH       ; AirspeedASPDL       ;ALTH        ; Alitiude in feetALTLVOLTH       ; resolution of 0.1 VoltsVOLTLFUELFH      ; Fuel Flow (Gallons/Hour) resolution of 0.1 gallons/hourFUELFL      ;UNIT        ; Internal Insturment temperatureCARB        ; 2's complimentROCSGN      ; Vertical speed - 100 fpm resolution 2's complimentOATH        ; 2's compliment - there is no low wordOILTH       ; Oil TemperatureOILTLOILPAUX1H       ; Auxiliary 1AUX1LAUX2H       ; Auxiliary 2AUX2LAUX3H       ; Auxiliary 3AUX3LAUX4H       ; Auxiliary 4AUX4LCOOLH       ; Coolant TemperatureCOOLLETIH        ; Hourmeter - Resolution = 0.1 hoursETIL        ;QTYH        ; Fuel Quantity (fuel flow totalizer) Resolution = 0.1 gallonsQTYLHRS         ; Flight timer hoursMIN         ; Flight timer secondsSEC         ; Flight timer secondsENDHRS      ; Fuel FLow time until empty - HoursENDMIN      ; Fuel FLow time until empty - MinutesBAROH       ; Baroset in In HG - Resolution 0.01BAROL       ;MAGHDH      ; Magnetic Heading - Hi wordMAGHDL      ; Magnetic Heading - Lo word -resolution 0.1 degreesSPARE       ; Reserved.Checksum (data summed and result complimented) is transmit here - 1 word. The checksumdoes not include the header, but does include the "SPARE" word. The checksum is a single, 8-bit word.
